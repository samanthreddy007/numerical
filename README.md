# numerical
As decided in our discussion, to compare all algorithms we need to run them on same A, b and also start from same initial seed.
When you run the script it generates a common matrix 'A' and vector 'b' valid for all algorithms. Also the triangle algorithm will return a seed which other algorithms should use to begin iterations.
